# We use a build stage to build a wheel which we then copy and install
# in the second stage to minimize image size. This is mostly needed
# because setuptools_scm needs the full version info from git and git
# itself but including that in the final image would bloat its size.

# we are using the official python image with just a version tag here
# it comes with many tools needed to build and compile python packages
# which increases it's size but is helpful for building
